Description: Build HTTP clients using the cosockets API of the nginx Lua module.
 Based on the cosocket driver for the nginx embedded Lua language module.
 It is Because this module is based on the ngx_lua's cosocket API, it
 inherits the advantage of a real nonblocking behaviour running
 effectively on the underlying nginx server ultra-fast technology design,
 allowing Web developers making use of the Lua programming language to
 script and construct extremely high-performance web applications capable
 to handle 10K+ connections. Note that this module works for both nginx
 with the embedded Lua module and the OpenResty bundle. With this library
 we can build high-performance HTTP clients inside nginx.
